          <h2>The Temple</h2>
      <i class="fa-solid fa-ankh fa-2xl"></i>
      <p>I visited Egypt in the sweltering summer of 2022. Though I had been warned to mind the pushy sellers and escape the 45 degrees desert heat, there was no way this would put a damper on my trip to Egypt. Unsurprisingly, the pyramids in Giza and Saqqara were breathtaking, and the tombs in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor were nothing short of spectacular. Yet it is my time at the Temple of Seti I which ended up the true highlight of my time to Egypt.
      </p>
      <p class="temple-padding">Located in the ancient sacred city of Abydos, the temple is monumental. The main hall is lined with rows of gigantic columns while the columns, the walls, and even the ceilings are adorned with exquisite religious scenes and inscriptions. Part of the ceiling are still covered in sot, the remains of the many fires started by Christians who used the temple in the 7th century as a refuge from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt" target="_blank">invading Muslims</a>. The feeling one inevitably has walking around a temple so richly decorated is hard to describe. It's almost overwhelming. It thus came as no surprise to learn that the temple is in fact regarded as the finest example of ancient Egyptian reliefs.</p>

    <p>The temple was built during the reigns of Seti I (1290-1279 BCE) and was completed by his son, Ramses II (1279-1213 BCE). Primarily dedicated to the gods Osiris, the main god of Abydos, it also honours his wife, Isis, his son, Horus, and Ptah-Sokar, Nefertem, Ra-Horakhty, and Amun. The temple contains six chapels dedicated to each god, as well as one additional chapel dedicated, perhaps unsurprisingly, to Seti I himself. The temple was built half a century after the end of the Amarna era, a tumultuous time that saw Akhenaten declare a new monotheistic religion centered around Aten. A country of many gods, Akhenaten's heretic break from traditional Egyptian religion was deeply unpopular. The changes were reversed soon after his death by Tutankhamon, better known today as King Tut. The temple was a clear attempt at reviving the old ways, with most of its reliefs depicting the veneration of the traditional Egyptian gods.

      <p>To enter the temple, one must go through two open courtyards. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylon_(architecture)" target="_blank">pylon</a> that once stood there is now destroyed, a similar faith that of the seven doorways that once guarded the temple. In the first hypostyle, reliefs depicts Ramses II killing Asiatics, worshipping Osiris, and making offering to the gods. The second hypostyle, with its 24 sandstone papyrus columns is adorned with intricate reliefs depicting religious scenes. At the rear are the sanctuaries for the gods, the largest one being dedicated to Osiris.
        
      <p>The temple's historical significance goes beyond its artistic craftsmanship. In the Gallery of Kings is a long list of pharaohs, an invaluable resource to historians today. Interestingly the list excludes certain pharaohs, such as those of the Amarna era, whom contemporary pharaohs sought to erase from history. The temple has also gained a certain notoriety for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Seti_I_(Abydos)#/media/File:Hieroglif_z_Abydos.jpg" target="_blank">helicopter hieroglyphs</a>, a carving that appears to depict examples of modern technology. The carving is in fact the result of erosion. The initial carving made during the reign of Seti I, which reads "He who repulses the nine [enemies of Egypt]", was filled with plaster and re-carved under the reign of Ramses II with one reading "He who protects Egypt and overthrows the foreign countries". As centuries went by, erosion revealed parts of both inscriptions and led to much speculations in the following millennia.</p>

    <h2>Abydos</h2>
    <p>As ancient Egypt's most sacred city, Abydos was the most appropriate site for Seti I's temple. For more than 3,000 years the city was a center of pilgrimage where pharaohs and commoners alike partook in festivals and processions to honor the gods. Pharaohs built large temple complexes, which were then enlarged in the following centuries. </p>
    <p>Abydos was the final resting place of numerous early Pharaohs, most prominently at the Umm el-Qa'ab royal necropolis. The upper-class followed suit, building elaborate tombs depicting their pilgrimage to the city. This in turn made Abydos a bustling town where vendors offered amulets and carved stelae, and where priests, farmers, bakers, craftsmen, and accountants lived on the fertile plain around the temples and supported the temples' activities and tended to the many pilgrims.</p>

          <h2>The Cult of Osiris</h2>  
<p>For millennia, Egypt was a society centered  around the concept of life after death. As the god of the afterworld, Osiris thus played a central role in the religion life of ancient Egyptians. He is thought to have gained prominence following the decline of Abydos' original god, the jackal god Khentymentiou, as the city was becoming an important funerary site. We associate his worship with death is actually more accurately linked to life and rebirth. Known as the "foremost of the Westerners" (where the sun rises), Osiris was the controller of the nile floods, and sunrise and sunset. He was at the center of the cycle of life and death. Together with the many other Egyptian gods, Osiris oversaw the harmony of all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Osiris also served as the provider of divine justice. After death, a person was to face judgement by a tribunal of 42 divine judges. In front of Osiris the soul of the death was weighed against a feather. If the soul weighted less than the feather, the dead was welcomed into the kingdom of Osiris. If not, he was to be thrown to Ammit, who would devour the soul and prevent him from attaining eternal life.</p>
<p>The origin story of Osiris is a tragic one. Different versions exist, but they all center around the theme of a struggle between order and disorder. Osiris was Egypt's original ruler, a descendent of the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His brother Set, apparently out of revenge, orchestrated his assassination. One accounts claims that Set fooled Osiris int getting into a box, which was then shut and thrown into the Nile. Other accounts claims that his body was divided into 26 pieces. Isis, Osiris' wife, searched for his remains around Egypt. Isis found all pieces of her husband except the phallus. Some believed the she revived Osiris with a spell so he could impregnate her. She eventually gave birth to Horus, the god of the Sun. This story was ritualized every year during the month of Khoiak (October - November) by priests who reenacted at Abydos the martyrdom of Osiris.</p>

    <h2>Seti I</h2>
    <p>The reign of Seti I was a watershed moment in Egyptian history. He reigned for a period estimated to be 13 years from 1291 BC. He strove to move away from the tumultuous years under the Amarna kings by ordering major building projects and an active foreign policy. Art and culture flourished during his reign, with such examples as his temple at Abydos but also the great Hypostyle Hall in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, which showcase what some believe to be the epitome of ancient Egyptian art. The ramifications of his reign continued after his death. His son, Ramses II, continued to oversee major architectural projects and came to be known as the greatest pharaoh of ancient Egypt. Seti I’s resting place is one of the most richly decorated tombs of the Valley of the Kings. And oddly enough, Seti I is today known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seti_I#/media/File:Pharaoh_Seti_I_-_His_mummy_-_by_Emil_Brugsch_(1842-1930).jpg" target="_blank">most handsome mummy</a> there is.
